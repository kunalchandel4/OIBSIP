# Java Development Internship - OASIS INFOBYTE

Thank you for visiting the repository for Oasis Infobyte Java Development Projects.They enabled me to demonstrate my expertise and abilities and these assignments are intended to help you develop your Java programming abilities and demonstrate your knowledge.

## Project 1: ATM Interface

ATM interface was the first project I worked on. The most difficult of each of the projects, it required me to create a console-based programme that mimicked the features of an ATM machine. The user had to be prompted for input, a menu of choices had to be presented, and account balances had to be updated in response to the user's activities. My ability to use classes, objects, and methods, in particular, has improved as a result of this project.


## Project 2: Number Guessing Game

A game of guessing numbers was the second undertaking I worked on. Although this project was very straightforward, it nevertheless allowed me to improve my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I was able to add functions like  extra rounds, and a score display based on the quantity of tries. Additionally, working on this project helped me better understand Java programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming.
